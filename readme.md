Contents Overview
a. Prerequisites
b. Files and their explanations

a. Prerequisites
1. Anaconda environment based on Python 3.10.14
2. Visual studio code working in that environment 
3. Jupyter Notebook and Python extensions installed
4. Crosscheck the working Python interpretor and kernel

b. Files and their explanations
1. learn-python-2.ipynb - Completed data science tutorials on learnpython.org which covers Numpy arrays and Pandas basics dealing with dataframe operations.
2. learn-python-3.ipynb - Completed advanced tutorials on learnpython.org which covers generators, lambda functions, decorators, closures, exception handling, sets, Json and Pickle for data serialization, OOP basics,etc.
3. python-tutorial-1-10.ipynb - Completed Python Basics Section 1-10 on pythontutorial.net which covers fundamentals, operators, if-else, loops, functions, lists, dictionaries, sets operations, exc 
4. python-tutorial-11.ipynb - Completed Python Basics Section 11 on pythontutorial.net which covers modules, module search path, __name__ variable and packages. While executing packages I made a folder names sales and made new py files as mentioned in tutorial namely billing, delivery and orders which is then imported in the final code cell of this ipynb file and executed.
5. python-tutorial-12-15.ipynb - Completed Python Basics Section 12-15 on pythontutorial.net which covers working with files, csv files, working with directories, f-strings, raw strings and backslash.
6. Python Numpy Tutorial.ipynb - Completed Python Numpy Tutorial on  https://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/ which covers Python basics, data types, containers, functions, classes, numpy array, broadcasting, scipy and matplotlib. While executing scipy tutorial imread package was not working as it was depreciated in the new version. Hence I used an equivalent package named imageio and executed the tutorial using it. The images that I used are kept in assets folder.
